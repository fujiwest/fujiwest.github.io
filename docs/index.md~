The Infinite Salmon is a blog dedicated to the topic of careers in science, including doing a PhD, completing a dissertation, and making sense of this weird life and lifestyle people in science tend to choose for themselves.  The Infinite Salmon is run by a principal investigator, scientist, former professor, and sometimes academic-skeptic.  Their Ph.D. is in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
